# OpenSnip

*A clean, modern open source temporary code paste tool.*

Many existing open source pastebins feel outdated, lack modern features like good syntax highlighting, often require user accounts, or are difficult to deploy. OpenSnip aims to address these shortcomings by providing a simple, modern, and easily deployable alternative for sharing code snippets.

## Development

To get started with development:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Backend

OpenSnip's backend is entirely powered by [Blobse](https://github.com/MatthewScholefield/blobse).
